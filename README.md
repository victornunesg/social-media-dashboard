# Social media dashboard with theme switcher

![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## About the project

This is a challenge from the FrontEnd Challenge website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). 
The objective is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
